### Is YouTube a political weapon?

## Abstract

Most political ideologies can be identified by their position on the political spectrum. The two main categories are left and right. The left-right dimension is focusing on the political beliefs regarding economic issues. In order to understand these statements, we could use a natural language processing model to categorise the political affiliation of a channel based on its videosâ€™ text description. We could see which political affiliation is more prevalent and also correlated with a higher engagement rate. We could also explore the political trends in Youtube over time using the time series and see whether or not they have changed. We could also explore the interaction between conservative and liberal users by exploring the comment table. We can inpher the political orientation of a user based on the majority of the videos they have commented on and see how many conservatives have left comments on right-leaning videos and how many liberals replied to right-leaning content.

## Research questions

* Is YouTube strictly politically unbiased or does it have its own preferences?
* Is the conversation always one-sided or do they interact?
* Is it a bad thing for a channel to change the direction of the video that they are producing?
